        "content": "<p>Before we announce the third project in Uno Re’s COHORT I, we thought we’d take a minute and share a quick recap of the AMA that took place on the 18th of August with our wonderful partner,&nbsp;<strong>Umbrella Network</strong>.</p><p>Founders,&nbsp;<strong>Jaskanwar Singh</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Sujith Sizon&nbsp;</strong>joined the Umbrella Network community to revel in the benefits of what the partnership between the two projects entailed.</p><p><strong><em>| Highlights of the AMA:</em></strong></p><p>Intent of the partnership:-</p><p>With this partnership,&nbsp;<strong>Umbrella Network</strong>&nbsp;is looking to make staking and providing liquidity even safer and more worry-free for the community. Those staking tokens in Umbrella Network vaults will soon have the option to purchase risk coverage on their staked tokens.&nbsp;<strong>PolkaCover</strong>&nbsp;will be responsible for distribution and claim management, while&nbsp;<strong>Uno Re</strong>&nbsp;will undertake the risk management and underwriting.</p><p><strong>Q) Umbrella Network users will be offered a staking cover. What does this mean exactly?</strong></p><p><strong><em>Jas:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Basically, users coming onto the Umbrella Network platform to stake $UMB within the two proffered pools — stakers of their LP staking pool Polar Stream, and Single-Sided Staking pool Hadley Stream, will now have the option to insure this staked amount as they stake it.</em></p><p><strong><em>Sujith:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We believe that insurance on crypto-funds for the community is the absolute need of the hour — essentially, Uno Re will provide a Staking Pool Cover for both of Umbrella Network’s staking pools individual users will be able to insure their stake upto a maximum cover of USD 10,000. We will cover Umbrella Network’s users for a total amount of USD500,000!</em></p><p><strong>Q) That is amazing! Did not think that was something that was available in the market. What are the benefits of a staking cover though? Why would users need it?</strong></p><p><strong><em>Sujith:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Like I said, the need for insurance within the crypto-space has never been as stark as it is now — specifically for smart contract hacks, in the last 4 years alone there has been a massive loss of capital due to exploits adding upto over $2.5 Billion. In fact, in just the past few weeks, these exploits have led to a loss of over $650M in cryptocurrency. With such high numbers, I think it’s fairly apparent that the crypto community must be adequately insured against such catastrophic losses</em></p><p><strong><em>Jas:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Uno Re aims to fill this massive gap within the space and step in to fulfil this need for protection and we feel strongly that the crypto community deserves such contingencies in place in order to protect their hard-earned funds.</em></p><p><strong>Q) How can users who have just joined Umbrella Network’s staking programme purchase this policy?</strong></p><p><strong><em>Jas:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;On Umbrella Network’s platform, users who’d like to stake capital in exchange for rewards will now have the opportunity to additionally secure their staked funds — at the time of staking, Uno Re will provide the option for stakers on Umbrella’s staking portal to be able to view the estimated quote price for the coverage, priced in $UMB. The premium will be 4% of TVL for an annual policy and prorated if the duration is less than 1 year. After staking in the pool, the estimated quote will change into a final price and that’s all, the user is now insured.</em></p><p><strong><em>Sujith:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;There will also be a dashboard set up for users who want to check the details of the bought policy — and of course, we will release more details closer to the programme launch so make sure to keep an eye out for that as well</em></p><p><strong>Q) What about Umbrella stakers who are already part of the staking programme?</strong></p><p><strong><em>Sujith:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>That’s a great question — I’m so glad you asked! Of course, we cater to these users as well; everyone deserves to have security on their hard-earned crypto. To enable this, we’ve joined forces with a mutual partner of ours and Umbrella Network’s — existing stakers will be able to purchase insurance cover on their staked token on PolkaCover (an insurance aggregator marketplace); PolkaCover’s handy platform will also be used to administer and manage all claims associated with these insured’s policies.</em></p><p><strong><em>Jas:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;To put it simply, the user will head over to PolkaCover’s platform from a link on the Umbrella Staking portal and connect their wallet; the wallet will be automatically scanned to detect the staked funds of the user, based on which they will be able to view the computed quote for their policy, which they can then purchase on the spot! — easy as that.</em></p><p>This pretty much sums up all the nitty-gritty details of the AMA. We are super excited for the launch of our dApp in the coming weeks and we hope you’re just as thrilled as we are.</p><p>See you!</p><p><strong>About Uno Re:</strong></p><p>Uno Re will be the world’s first decentralized reinsurance platform powered by Polkadot, allowing the community to invest and trade in ‘risk’ and receive sizable returns on their investments in one of the safest asset classes in the world.
